# The Basics
1. Python Interpreter
2. Variables

Note: Run the examples with the following command.
```
python3 index.py  
```

## My first program

```py
print("Hello Bel")
```

### Using Variables

```py
wave = "Hello Bel"
print(wave)
```

## Variables
## Strings
We can use single quotes or double quotes. Flexibility

### Methods of Strings
- `title()`
- `upper()`
- `lower()`

```py
wave = "Hello Bel"
print(wave.title())
```

### String interpolation
For string interpolation we need to use f-strings, so python understands string interpolation.



## Numbers

- `+` add
- `-` minus
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `**` exponents

### Order

```
>>> 2 + 3*4
14
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
20
```

### Floats

````
>>> 0.1 + 0.1
0.2
>>> 0.2 + 0.2
0.4
````

````
>>> 0.2 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004
>>> 3 * 0.1
0.30000000000000004
````

Divisions always return a float

#### Constants
variable all in capital letters

### Comments
```
# Something
# This is a comment
```

Experienced Python programmers will encourage you to avoid complexity and aim for simplicity whenever possible


Run Zen of Python by `python3` and running `import this`



```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
